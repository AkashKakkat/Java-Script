Functions are block of code design to perform partricular task




1 => Function-Declaration

  function declaration one of the ways to define the function

  Function Function_name(parameter){
    function_body
  }
  Function_name("arguments");

  -----Key-Features-----
  * hoisting -> calling a function before defining it
  * named-Function -> function declaration must have a function name
  * global-scope -> its defines outside any block, globally-scoped
  * local-scope -> its defines only inside a block, locally-scoped




2 => Function-Expression

  function expression is a way to define inside an expression and assign into variable

   let variable_name = function(){
    function_body
   }

   -----Key-Features-----
   * Anounimous/name -> function without a name is called Anounymous function
   * not hoisting
   * can be assinged to variables/objects
   * can be used as an argument





3 => Arrow-Function

Arrow function is a shortway syntax of writing function in JS , Indroduced in ES6 (ECMA-SCRIPT)


4 => CallBack-Function

 * Function passing another function as an Argument
 * Handle Asyncronous operations
 * Customise behaviour of genereal purpose Functions
 * Avoid blocking code execution
 
5 => IIFE(Immediatly Invoked Function Expression)

 * Imediately Invoked
 * Data privacy => variables defined inside IIFE are not accessable outside
 * Closure => an inner function inside an outer function
 * Self-Contain => Execute independantly without effecting surrrounding code 


 


Pre-Defined Functions (Built-In Functions)

1 => String Functions

2 => Date Functions

3 => Math Functions
